# MelbDjango Project

So, you've done our [Guestbook assignment][gh-guestbook], now it's time to move beyond that and onto your own project!


### Make Something Cool

This time all we want you to do is create something awesome that uses the skills you've learned in MelbDjango School Season 3.


That means creating something that use some or all of Django views, forms, models, admin, templates, JSON, etc.. Perhaps most importantly - tests!
We have classes coming up on some advanced Django topics (Lesson 9) and deploying your projects (Lesson 8), so we expect you to use some of those.
And don't forget that the [Django documentation][dj-docs] are awesome.


If you've got existing experience with Javascript, CSS, HTML, etc. you should use as much of that as possible to show off what you can do.
If you don't, don't worry too much.
Perhaps explore CSS frameworks like [Bootstrap][twbs], [Pure][pure] or [Material Design Lite][mdl] to make things easier.


Feel free to go a step further and do things like creating (or using!) an API.
Try exploring [third party apps][dj-packages] that other people have written for Django.


You should be able to host your project on Heroku or AWS (Lesson 8) for free!

We'd love for you to demo this one to the class at our MelbDjango on September 10th! Please let us know in your PR if you're keen (I hope you are!).
