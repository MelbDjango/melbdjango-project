# Jobflow

This is a webapp that uses @StackDevJobs twitter feed to present the available jobs in a different views. 

## Technology view

* This is the default view. The first half of the page consist of clickable tags. The tags are the technology required by the job posting. The second half of the page is the @StackDevJobs twitter feed.
* When I click on a tag, the twitter feed below is filtered by the tag

## Viz view

* This is another view which represents the number of jobs sorted per technology. 
* I'm thinking of using a bubble graph to represent each technology in this figure.

## My jobs view

* This is a simple list view that displays a list of shortlisted jobs.
